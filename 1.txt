iNTHEBEGINNING, I wasn’t there. I don’t
 think the Ancient Greeks were, either.
 Nobody had a pen and paper to take notes,
 so I can’t vouch for what follows, but I can
14/999
 tell you it’s what the Greeks thought
 happened.
 At first, there was pretty much nothing. A
 lot of nothing.
 The first god, if you can call it that, was
 Chaos—a gloomy, soupy mist with all the
 matter in the cosmos just drifting around.
 Here’s a fact for you: Chaos literally means
 the Gap, and we’re not talking about the
 clothing store.
 Eventually Chaos got less chaotic. Maybe
 it got bored with being all gloomy and misty.
 Some of its matter collected and solidified
 into the earth, which unfortunately de
veloped a living personality. She called her
self Gaea, the Earth Mother.
 Now Gaea was the actual earth—the
 rocks, the hills, the valleys, the whole
15/999
 enchilada. But she could also take on hu
manlike form. She liked to walk across the
 earth—which was basically walking across
 herself—in the shape of a matronly woman
 with a flowing green dress, curly black hair,
 and a serene smile on her face. The smile hid
 a nasty disposition. You’ll see that soon
 enough.
 After a long time alone, Gaea looked up
 into the misty nothing above the earth and
 said to herself: “You know what would be
 good? A sky. I could really go for a sky. And
 it would be nice if he was also a handsome
 man I could fall in love with, because I’m
 kind of lonely down here with just these
 rocks.”
